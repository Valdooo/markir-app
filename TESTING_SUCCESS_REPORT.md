## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Web Dependencies**: Always install react-dom and react-native-web for Expo web support
2. **Minimal Testing**: Testing with minimal app first helps isolate environment vs code issues
3. **Error Isolation**: Browser console is essential for debugging runtime errors
4. **Incremental Development**: Adding features step-by-step makes debugging easier
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript caught many errors before runtime
